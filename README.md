# PromiseFSM.js

A simple JavaScript Finite State Machine (FSM), using Promises.

This library was written with front-end UI purposes in mind (as seen in the examples), but it should also be usable in other contexts such as Node applications.

#### Features

* Simple yet powerful API.
* Actors can subscribe/unsubscribe to events.
* Actors can add/remove blocking transitions.
* Multiton pattern allows multiple stateMachines to run in parallel.
* Available in different flavours:
  * Vanilla JavaScript.
  * NodeJS module.
  * AngularJS 1.x service module.
  * ... is your fave framework missing? Please [contribute](#contribute).

#### Release notes

##### v0.1.0:

* alpha version

## Getting started

#### Installation

PromiseFSM needs a library to create promises. It has been tested with P by Robert KatiÄ‡ (bundled with PromiseFSM in the `/vendor` folder or get it [here](https://github.com/rkatic/p)) and $q (bundled with AngularJS)

##### Vanilla

Load a promise lib and the library
```
<script src="P.min.js"></script>
<script src="PromiseFSM.min.js"></script>
```

##### AngularJS 1.x

The angular version uses $q (bundled with Angular) as the default promise library, so there's no need to load anything but the module itself:

Load the script

``` html
<script src="PromiseFSM-AngularJS.1.x.min.js"></script>
```
Include the module in your Angular app.

``` javascript
var app = angular.module("myApp", ["PromiseFSMModule"]);
```

#### Usage

To create an instance of a state machine, you need a `name` and some `options`. 

Let's use a door as an example. The door has three states: "open", "closed" or "locked".

```
var name = "doorMachine";
var options = {
	verbose: true, // optional
	initialState: "closed", // optional, if not present initial state will default to first state in the "states" array.
	states: ["opened", "closed", "locked"],
	actions: {
		open   : { from: "closed", to: "opened" },
		close  : { from: "opened", to: "closed" },
		lock   : { from: "closed", to: "locked" },
		unlock : { from: "locked", to: "closed" }
	}
};
```

The specified `actions` will be created as methods on your stateMachine instance. Let's create it:

```
var stateMachine = PromiseFSM.create(name, options);
```
Let's listen to the STATE_CHANGED event:

```
stateMachine.$addEventListener(PromiseFSM.STATE_CHANGED, function(evt) {
	console.log(stateMachine.$getState());
});
```

All set up! Now, to change states, simply invoke the action methods. A simple way to do this would be like this:

```
openButton.onclick = stateMachine.open;
closeButton.onclick = stateMachine.close;
lockButton.onclick = stateMachine.lock;
unlockButton.onclick = stateMachine.unlock;
```
A slightly more advanced example utilizing the fact that action methods returns "then-able" promises:

```
openButton.onclick = function() {
	stateMachine.open().then(function() {
		// state change was successful
	}, function(reason) {
		// state change failed because of reason
	});
};
```

Check the examples folder for more examples using promises.

## API

#### PromiseFSM.setPromiseAdapter(adapter)

Sets what adapter to use for subsequent state machine creation, anything that is Promises/A+ compliant should work (please file an issue if it doesn't).

```
PromiseFSM.setPromiseAdapter(P);
```

#### PromiseFSM.create(name, options)

Creates a new state machine instance and returns its interface.

```
var stateMachine = PromiseFSM.create(name, options);
```

#### PromiseFSM.getMachine(name)

Returns the interface of the state machine instance named `name` or `undefined` if it doesn't exist.

```
var stateMachine = PromiseFSM.getMachine(name);
```

### State machine instances

#### StateMachine.$getState

Returns the current state of the state machine.

```
var currentState = stateMachine.$getState();
```

#### StateMachine.$addTransition(from, to, callback)

Add a blocking transition. Your state machine instance will not change the current state until all transitions have called the `done()` method.

```
stateMachine.$addTransition("state1", "state2", callback);

function callback(done) {

	// do your asynchronous stuff then call done(), so that the stateMachine can 
	// proceed with the state change (or wait for other transitions to complete).

	done();
};
```

#### StateMachine.$removeTransition(from, to, callback)

```
stateMachine.$removeTransition("state1", "state2", callback);
```

#### StateMachine.$addEventListener

```
stateMachine.$addEventListener(type, callback);
```
An event object is passed to the callback with three properties, `type`, `from` (the state we are transitioning from) and `to` (the state we are transitioning to).

When an action method is called, the machine instance emits the following events:

| Type											| When |
|---------------------------|------|
|`PromiseFSM.LOCKED`				|First thing that happens when an action method is called (action methods deactivated)|
|`PromiseFSM.EXIT_STATE`		|Immediately before transition handlers are invoked|
|`PromiseFSM.ENTER_STATE`		|Immediately after all transitions are completed ($getState now returns new state)|
|`PromiseFSM.UNLOCKED`			|State machine is unlocked (action methods reactivated)|
|`PromiseFSM.STATE_CHANGED`	|State change is completed.|

If you don't know what event to listen to, use the `STATE_CHANGED` event.

#### StateMachine.$removeEventListener

Removes an event listener.

```
stateMachine.$removeEventListener(type, callback);
```

## Roadmap/ideas

* Guards
* ES6/ES6-shim Promise by default instead of P
* Test other promise libraries than P and $q
* Version for other frameworks such as Backbone
* Wiki

## Contribute

Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Do `npm install` to download the build dependencies.
3. Do your thang.
4. Run `gulp` to test and build. Please check the gulpfile for the complete list of gulp tasks.

If you want to run the tests without gulp, you'll install [mocha](http://mochajs.org/#installation) globally `npm install -g mocha` then run `mocha`.

The idea behind the test names is that they should be easily "grep-able", for example `mocha --grep "#$getState() after_state_change"`.
